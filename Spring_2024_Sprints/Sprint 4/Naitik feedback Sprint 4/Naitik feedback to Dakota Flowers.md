Dakota is on the Angry Birds team and had to note the timestamps to when the bird comes and leaves the nest etc. For the most part, they had the entire app up and running as they wanted. However, there were still some potential issues I pointed out that can be worked on. 

First, when the user opens the app but doesnt add the video yet, it says there's no preview available, which is the accepted behaviour. However, when the user uploads the file it still said "No preview" which suggests a bug.

Next, when the first video was uploaded already, and the user tried to upload a second video to test, it didn't work as expected. The app wasn't able to handle multiple video uploads. 

Finaly, the sensitivity was pretty high for noting the time stamps. So if the bird is sitting on the nest feeding the babies, it'd count multiple instances of the same visit. Though it wasn't essentially a bad thing since in the particular case, the more timestamps the merrier. still I advised him to try and play around with the sensitivity and see how it changes the process of recording the timestamps.

So, I basically advised him to play along with these things, and try if these things can be improved on for the remaining of sprint 4. The app works but there were just these epecifics that can be brushed upon.
