Their name is:,Chris Smalley,I don't have a third teammate,,I don't have a fourth teammate,,"• Actually coding! • Because our clients instructed us to focus on getting our development environments set up and due to amount and dissimilar types of issues each of our members have experienced, beyond the project pitch and briefly discussing it during our inital client meeting, we lack details about true aim of the project. Conceptually, we know what needs to be done, but we don't really have a gameplan. I would like to begin by creating and mapping user stories so that we can populate our Kanban board (using GH Projects) at least generally. We could refine and assign tasks once we have better information. I believe we need to get at least this far before our next client meeting on Tuesday following spring break, because the absolute deadline for setting up the project is that day. Even sooner would be better, because there's not much I can currently work on until we address this and don't want to waste the remaining time we have.","• We have been communicating regularly, which is great and additional perspective has been beneficial in troubleshooting the issues we've encountered thus far. However, I think our meetings and daily checkins/standups would benefit from more structure. I feel that the reason they've lacked good structure thus far is because our time has been spent researching and troubleshooting issues that must generally be addressed in order and have spanned days. Therefore, in many cases the quality of our checkins has suffered because some offer little if any new information and others no information due to dead ends. Regardless, I think we could benefit from establishing a rubric or structure to use for checkins even if the quality and substance is likely to improve once we begin the development and coding portion of the project and once we have established clear tasks and assignments. • Improving the agenda and following it more closely would also lead to more effective use of our time in meetings. • Scheduling makes it difficult, but I think more in-person meetings would be beneficial because it is easier to communicate, brainstorm, iterate and repeat. This would allow us to make more progress over the same amount of time. Our in-person meetings last a bit longer than checkins, but are a more effective use of time because feedback is quick. • Screenshots are a great way to communicate a lot of information and sometimes include critical details that might not be included in a verbal or written description. Personally, I've found that including screenshots to provide context and detail is helpful by ensuring each of us is on the same page.","As mentioned, our communication has been fantastic thus far and has greatly exceeded the minimum amount we defined in our contract. Everyone has been responsive within minutes or hours to all communication via Discord, and we have been able to collaborate in real time or close to it. I hope this continues, and there is no reason to expect otherwise.","• The nature of our work will likely change soon as we begin testing and development, but I think we can be more conscientious of time and effort moving forward. In hindsight, we have not made optimal use of our limited time for some tasks. We spent days troubleshooting a particular issue that might have been more easily solved by restart or finding an alternative means - for example, using alternative, equivalent software known to be working if issues persist for too long. • We spent roughly a week trying to fix the master backend due to a miscommunication with our client that wasn't made clear until our next scheduled meeting. We can definitely avoid this mistake in the future by setting stricter time limits before reaching out to the client with questions or for clarifications that we can't address within the team. • Since our time to meet in person is limited, I would like to reduce the amount of time we spend off track. I think it's actually very important to foster good relationships and socialize in a team environment, but we may need to consider this balance because we sometimes get off track.","• As a team, I cannot think of anything that we need to stop doing. Areas that we currently excel in or need to improve describe all of the behavior and habits that warrant attention. • Personally, I'm not confident that my interaction with the team is always appreciated. If it's not obvious by now, I have an awful habit of being too verbose which is conditionally appropriate. I'm worried that I can sometime be insufferable in this way and want to make sure that I don't annoy or upset my teammates by wasting their time or offering unwanted/unnecessary ""advice.""",Always,Always,Always,Always,Most of the time,About half the time,Is organized.,Most of the time,Always,Always,Always,Always,Always,Adds valuable perspective and direction to discussions.

At the start of this sprint when we decided on our task plan and began development, we encountered a error preventing progress specifically for the portion of code related to the project (enabling datasets and Screens/Components related to our target WFs), which further diverted our attention and time. I was the only lucky team member who was able to run all parts of the app, but wasn't able to make as much progress toward our development goals as we would have liked. We don't have enough progress at this point to warrant any functional testing, but that's another task that we hope to accomplish moving forward. If everyone isn't able to run the project and complete tasks individually after this sprint's completion, we'll need to start doing collaborative coding sessions in person, virtually by screen sharing, or making use of a tool such as CodeSandbox.","We've adjusted our workflow and means of communication following responses from this prompt during the last sprint. It wasn't possible until very late in this sprint to do this, but making use of our project board would be the most qualifying answer--those of us who were able have been using it, but it reflects our limited progress. At the time of writing, both Andre and Elliott are able to continue development-related goals, so we'll need to continue doing this.","Collaborating and communicating as we have been doing. I think we're actually making efficient use of time, and I hate to blame external circumstances, but our lack of progress is not really the result of anything we should discontinue or need to start doing. We should keep moving forward just like we have been. We've been making consistent progress, but resolving errors has also consistently led to new errors. Now, the majority of our team is able to focus on meeting the client's goals, so I would like to continue this trajectory with the time left.","I'm hesitant to say missing our scheduled meetings because circumstances that led to this were unique on each occasion, but that's the only behavior that would benefit us to do less of. We have items in our contract to deal with this, but the group's consensus is that it hasn't been problematic or detrimental toward our goals.","Modifying in any way the dependency trees or installed packages. This answer is partly in jest and partly serious--but now that we've got almost everyone running, we should avoid updating any packages or dependencies now.

The client was alright in the beginning of the semester but towards the end, his attitude towards us became a little disrespectful. Matiwos has trouble speaking english sometimes and he had a question that he wanted to ask and he had trouble formulating it and getting it into words. Our client said that matiwos should think before he speaks and that it would be best if he could think about his question and speak it clearly next time.

He was pivotal in figuring out authentication but besides that he disappeared. It felt like he was doing the bare minimum to get by. I had to force cody and jack into doing a group work session the last week so we could get some stuff done. Jack did not do any work related to our project during this work session. He also waited until there was less than 24 hours to start on the documentation which I asked him to help with since I have limited time with finals. The reason I know this is because he texted me today (05/01) asking how to actually get the project up and running. Most of the classwork conducted with him he just spent on his phone or doing other homework. I feel bad saying this, but I carried most of the load this sprint. It was extremely frustrating to find out that neither of them were really doing any participation when I had spent a large amount of time dedicated to figuring out the app. As I am writing this, I am pretty sure Jack is working on the documentation which is fantastic, but not great since we have less than 24 hours for the project to be due. Overall, this sprint was not nearly as good as I hoped and I be	lieve that if we had worked together better, the project would have ended up being amazing. "
